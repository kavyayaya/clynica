# Clynica

Clynica is a simple alternative to pen and paper for doctors to manage their patients and prescriptions in one place.

## Setup

### Backend

Requires Python 3.5+.

**Note**: It is recommended to run the following commands in a virtual environment.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Beauth/clynica.git
$ cd clynica/backend/flask/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 index.py
```

The Flask server runs on port 5500 by default. This can be changed in `index.py`.
